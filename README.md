Applied padding and margins to create space around text and elements, ensuring a clean and breathable layout.

🔹 🧊 Rounded Corners:
Used border-radius to soften the look of containers and buttons for a more modern UI.

🔹 🧭 Layout & Positioning:
Organized elements using alignment and spacing techniques to keep everything readable and well-placed over the background.
